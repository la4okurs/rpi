This directory not_important/ is just a directory for doing some tests of
my new wonderful Raspberry Pi based high quality IQAUDIO sound card

To start on RPI:

pi@raspberrypi:~/rpi/not_important      $ bash stream.bash

Any time you may get run status from:  $ bash stream.bash status

Feel free to add entries in the file not_important/radiolist.txt  which is read by the

stream.bash program
