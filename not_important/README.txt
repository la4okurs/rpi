This directory not_important/ is just a directory for doing some tests of
my new wonderful Raspberry Pi based high quality IQAUDIO sound card

To start on RPI:

$ cd rpi/not_important

pi@raspberrypi:~/rpi/not_important $ bash radio_cmd.bash

Any time you may run status from:  $ bash radio_cmd.bash status

Feel free to add entries in the file not_important/radiolist.txt  which is read by the

radio_cmd.bash program
